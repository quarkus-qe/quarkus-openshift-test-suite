/**
 * Marks the test class as OpenShift test.
 * That is, the JUnit extension for testing Quarkus applications on OpenShift will be applied.
 * <p>
 * For running the tests, you need to be logged into OpenShift ({@code oc login ...}).
 * <p>
 * The test framework requires that the {@code app-metadata} Quarkus extension is present, because
 * it heavily relies on the informations the extension collects into {@code target/app-metadata.properties}.
 * <p>
 * The {@code oc} binary needs to be present on {@code PATH}, as the test framework uses it.
 * <p>
 * Before running the tests in this class, the test application is deployed. It is expected that
 * the resources to be deployed are found in {@code target/kubernetes/openshift.yml}.
 * After the tests in this class finish, the application is undeployed.
 * <p>
 * The {@link io.quarkus.ts.openshift.common.injection.TestResource @TestResource} annotation
 * can be used to inject some useful objects. The annotation can be present on a field, or
 * on a test method parameter.
 * <p>
 * The {@link AdditionalResources @AdditionalResources} annotation can be used to deploy
 * additional OpenShift resources before the test application is deployed. These resources
 * are automatically undeployed after the test application is undeployed.
 * <p>
 * The {@link OnlyIfConfigured @OnlyIfConfigured} annotation can be used to selectively
 * enable/disable execution of tests based on a configuration property.
